# 274B-Final-Project  

Final Deliverables:

Delivery I: 
Submit a repository with the full software library distribution. Either one member from the team can email me the team's repository containing final files or you can add me as a collaborator to a private repository if it is hosted on GitHub.
Every team member submits their solutions for grading to each assignment (levels 1, 2, 3, and 4) in the Gradescope platform.
A UML diagram of your choice relevant to modeling the design of your project implementation. The UML diagram need not reflect the full implementation of levels 1 through 4, but should at minimum reflect the implementation details of at least 1 level.
Think of this as a way of showing partial credit for levels where you don’t pass all test cases. If you can show that your thought process is on the right track, then that may make up some points from failing test cases.
Only one team member needs to email me the diagram. Please provide your team number in the file name.

Delivery II: Every team member submits a pdf with a software engineering reflection that includes:
A description of their role in the project.
How much do they contribute to the successful project completion (e.g. lead work, help others, coordinated meetings, etc).
Describe any challenges/problems you and/or your team dealt with and how you solved them.
Algorithmic and performance analysis of each method.
What could you have done differently:
Ex. Software project management
Ex. Final product improvements
